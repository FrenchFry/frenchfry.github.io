	<h1><b>Cover</b> Privacy Policy</h1>

	<div id="main">
		<p>This Privacy Policy describes how French Fry collects, uses, and shares information when you use the "Cover" application. By using our application, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

		<h2>1. Data collection, usage, retention and deletion</h2>
		<p>The "Cover" application does not collect any personal information. It may access and display the content of comic books stored on your local device, local network, OneDrive, Google Drive, and Dropbox. However, this access is limited to readonly permissions, and no data is ever transmitted to us or any third-party.</p>
		<p>Cover collects data (whether you use a locally owned storage or a cloud storage) from the folder you select and all its subfolders: File names, sizes and paths. This allows Cover to sync its library data with the file system data. This non-sensitive data is stored without any encryption in the app local database, and is kept until the user removes the folder from Cover or uninstalls the app.</p>
		<p>The application securely connects to cloud storage services (OneDrive™, Google Drive™, Dropbox™) to provide you with access to your comic book collection. The app only requests readonly access to your cloud storage, ensuring that no modifications or deletions are made to your files.<br/>
		For this purpose, Cover stores a short-lived access-token and a long-lived refresh token that lets it access or renew access to your cloud storage account. These tokens are stored locally and only there, secured by the built-in Windows Credentials manager (which encrypts data using your Windows password). They are kept until the user removes them, which can be done at any time from the app or from Windows credentials. It is used for the sole purpose of connecting the user to the cloud storage, and is never transferred or transmitted anywhere else.
		</p>
		<p>Limited technical information is sent (such as IP addresses included in the HTTP calls the application makes) but none of that is used or stored. Non-identifiable information (such as OS version, language settings) is sent to Microsoft AppCenter in the form of crash reports. Non-identifiable information is sent to StatHat in the form of usage statistics (purchase attempts/success,..).</p>

		<h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
		<p>The "Cover" application may use third-party services for analytics or other functionalities. These services may have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services.</p>

		<h2>3. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our practices. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Continued use of the "Cover" application after changes are made constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

		<h2>4. Contact Information</h2>
		<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <span class="contact-email">support@frenchfrysoftware.com</span>.</p>

		<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of the last updated date and may be subject to future revisions.</p>
