	<h1><b>Cover</b> Privacy Policy</h1>

	<div id="main">
		<p>This Privacy Policy describes how French Fry collects, uses, and shares information when you use the "Cover" application. By using our application, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

		<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
		<p>The "Cover" application does not collect any personal information. It may access and display the content of comic books stored on your local device, local network, OneDrive, Google Drive, and Dropbox. However, this access is limited to readonly permissions, and no data is transmitted to our servers.</p>
		<p>Limited technical information is sent (such as IP addresses included in the HTTP calls the application makes) but none of that is used or stored. Non-identifiable information (such as OS version, language settings) is sent to Microsoft AppCenter in the form of crash reports. Non-identifiable information is sent to StatHat in the form of usage statistics (purchase attempts/success,..).</p>

		<h2>2. Cloud Storage</h2>
		<p>The application securely connects to cloud storage services (OneDrive™, Google Drive™, Dropbox™) to provide you with access to your comic book collection. The app only requests readonly access to your cloud storage, ensuring that no modifications or deletions are made to your files.</p>

		<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
		<p>The "Cover" application may use third-party services for analytics or other functionalities. These services may have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services.</p>

		<h2>4. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our practices. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Continued use of the "Cover" application after changes are made constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

		<h2>5. Contact Information</h2>
		<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <span class="contact-email">support@frenchfrysoftware.com</span>.</p>

		<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of the last updated date and may be subject to future revisions.</p>
